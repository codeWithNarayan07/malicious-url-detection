# 🔐 Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Malicious URL Detection is a machine learning–based final year project that focuses on identifying and classifying harmful web links such as phishing, malware, and fraudulent URLs. With the increasing use of the internet, malicious URLs have become a major cybersecurity threat. This project provides an intelligent and automated approach to detect unsafe URLs and improve web security.

The system analyzes different characteristics of URLs and applies machine learning techniques to classify them as either **malicious** or **benign**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Cyber attackers commonly use malicious URLs to steal sensitive information, distribute malware, and perform phishing attacks. Traditional rule-based detection systems struggle to identify new and evolving threats. Therefore, an intelligent system using machine learning is required to accurately detect malicious URLs.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
The proposed system follows a supervised machine learning approach. The workflow of the project includes:

- Data collection and preprocessing  
- Feature extraction from URLs  
- Training machine learning models  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Predicting whether a URL is malicious or safe
